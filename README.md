# RGAAT_v2
1. Add multiple thread function for genome comparison
2. A perl script for multiple thread in BLAT was added
3. Highly recommend the comparison transfer should be 1 vs 1 alignment by blat which means you can split your query and target for 1 vs 1
4. New engine would be used soon for genome comparison
